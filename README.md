Image Annotator is a web application for easy and efficient image annotations,
developed by Nikhil Saxena with assistance from Mike Gloudemans, for the Hartemink 
Computational Biology Lab at Duke University.

To use Image Annotator, open the file "img_annot.html" using Firefox and click the
"Help" tab on the right side of the top bar for further instructions.

(We recommend Firefox because some of the JavaScript features have not yet been
adapted for functionality with other common browsers, such as Chrome.)
